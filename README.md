# Adding a custom REST resource for serving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images in KeyCloak

## Background

Most of the documentation needed to accomplish this is in the KeyCloak documentation, but I found that the docs spread things around in a confusing manner. The point of this example project is to show the simplest possible path to achieve the goal. Many thanks to my client (whom I will mention if they give me permission) who helped me see a simpler implementation was possible.
